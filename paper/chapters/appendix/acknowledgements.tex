\chapter{Acknowledgements}
% TODO: leave this in appendix or put this after the abstract?

I want to thank my (supervisors/mentors?) Dr. Julien Klaus and Prof. Dr. Joachim Giesen
for frequent high-quality feedback
and the ability to work on the topics that I considered interesting.
Additionally, I want to thank (M.Sc.?) Paul Rump for insightful conversations.
