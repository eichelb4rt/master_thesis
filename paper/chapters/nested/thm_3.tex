\section{Removing Duplications}

In the following theorem, we explore a way of compressing the expression
$$(ijk, jk \rightarrow ijk, A, (l \rightarrow ll, v))$$
for $A \in \R^{a \times b}, v \in \R^b$.
Again, we use disjoined sets of symbols for the inner and outer expression to help us in the formulation and the proof.

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:nested_einsum:3}

    For $i \in [m + n]$, let $T^{(i)}$ be an $n_i$-th order tensor with index strings $\bm{s_i} \in S^{n_i}$.
    Let $\bm{s_u}$ be an index string for the $n_u$-th order tensor $U$, which is defined as follows:
    $$U := (\bm{s_{m + 1}},\dots,\bm{s_{m + n}} \rightarrow \bm{s_u}, T^{(m + 1)},\dots,T^{(m + n)})$$
    Also let $\bm{\hat{s}_u}$ be alternative index strings for $U$ with $s_{uj} \neq s_{uj'} \implies \hat{s}_{uj} \neq \hat{s}_{uj'}$ for all $j, j' \in [n_u]$,
    which means that $\bm{\hat{s}_u}$ can only remove symbol duplications, and cannot introduce any.
    Note that this is the converse of the constraint in \autoref{thm:nested_einsum:2}.

    In our example, $\bm{s_u} = ll$ and $\bm{\hat{s}_u} = jk$.
    This removes the symbol duplication of the first and second index.

    Let $s_v$ be an index string and
    $$V := (\bm{s_1},\dots,\bm{s_m}, \bm{\hat{s}_u} \rightarrow \bm{s_v}, T^{(1)},\dots,T^{(m)}, U)$$
    where the first and second Einsum expression share no symbols.
    Then these nested Einsum expressions can also be compressed into a single Einsum expression.

    As in \autoref{thm:nested_einsum:3}, we need to apply a symbol map before substituting $\bm{\hat{s}_u}$.
    Interestingly, the symbol map is not applied to the index strings in the computation of $U$ ($\bm{s_{m + 1}},\dots,\bm{s_{m + n}}$),
    but to the index strings in the computation of $V$ ($\bm{s_1},\dots,\bm{s_m}$).
    Similarly, it does not map $\bm{s_u}$ to $\bm{\hat{s}_u}$, but $\bm{\hat{s}_u}$ to $\bm{s_u}$.

    Let $\mu: S \rightarrow S$ such that
    $$\mu(s) := \begin{cases}
            s_{uj} & \text{if }\exists j \in [n_u]: \hat{s}_{uj} = s \\
            s      & \text{else}
        \end{cases}$$
    $\mu$ can be extended in a similar way as $\nu$ to map entire index strings.

    Let $\bm{\hat{s}_i} := \mu(\bm{s_i})$ for $i \in [m]$, $\bm{\hat{s}_v} := \mu(\bm{s_v})$, then the compressed Einsum expression is the following:
    $$V = (\bm{\hat{s}_1},\dots,\bm{\hat{s}_m}, \bm{s_{m + 1}}, \dots, \bm{s_{m + n}} \rightarrow \bm{\hat{s}_v}, T^{(1)},\dots,T^{(m + n)})$$
    which helps us to compress the example:
    $$(ijk, jk \rightarrow ijk, A, (l \rightarrow ll, v)) = (ill, l \rightarrow ill, A, v)$$
    Note how even the index string for the output $\bm{s_v}$ was changed into $\bm{\hat{s}_v}$.
    This will become apparent in the proof.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    \small
    The key idea behind this proof, is that the entries of $U$, which were not defined in the computation, are set to the additive neutral element $\0$.
    This is useful, because in a semiring over some set $M$, the additive neutral element \textit{annihilates} $M$.
    This means, that for any $a \in M$, $a \cdot \0 = \0 \cdot a = \0$.
    Therefore, for any multiindex where $U$ is set to $\0$, $V$ is also set to $\0$.
    This means, that in the computation of $V$, only the indices which follow the duplications in $\bm{s_u}$ are defined.
    % Let us prove this formally.

    Let $\mathcal{I}, \mathcal{J}$ be the appropriate multi-index spaces for the computation of $V$. Then
    $$U_{IJ:\bm{\hat{s}_u}} = \0$$
    for all $IJ \in \mathcal{I} \times \mathcal{J}$ with
