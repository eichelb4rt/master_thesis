\chapter{Conclusion}

% nested statements are cool and easy.
% we have cool (promising?) naturally occuring examples.
% some deep learning stuff works half decently (convolution, max-pooling), because we can pre-compute stuff. This costs memory tho.
% some deep learning stuff is very ugly and einsum is not powerful enough to express it in 1 expression.
