% (why do we do it?)
Query Language, faster inference, stuff like that.
How can it be faster?
- we can optimize contraction path
- high parallelism allows for a lot of optimization with the use of vectorization
- intermediate steps in optimal contraction path can be optimized with pipelining
- we can optimize hardware specifically for computing Einsum expressions, which is pretty much just tensor operations.

By mapping a lot of problems to Einsum, we can spare time in trying to find efficient solutions for new problems,
and focus on optimizing the computation of Einsum expressions.
This reduces the effort of finding an efficient solution for a problem to finding a mapping of the problem to einsum.
% - pre-computing results that do not change?
% TODO: even useful when using Einsum in nested expression, because pipelining
