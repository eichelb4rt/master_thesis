\chapter{Abstract}

% Lead?
Frameworks like SAT and ILP are essential tools for coming up with quick solutions to natural problems.
We have not yet found such a framework that is powerful enough to solve modern inference problems
and specific enough to find good general optimization techniques.
% Development
Einsum seems like a promising candidate for that role because of its power and our ability to compute it efficiently with the optimization of the contraction path.
To find out if Einsum is a good fit for a universal inference language,
we tried to translate a small set of modern inference techniques to Einsum,
and explored a way of embedding nested Einsum expressions in the framework of Einsum.
% Resolution
We found that all nested Einsum expressions over the same semiring can be compressed into a single flat Einsum expression.
We were able to translate some inference techniques, but ultimately found that Einsum is probably not powerful enough for standard architectures in deep learning.
Instead, we could only describe them with mixtures of Einsum expressions over different semirings and element-wise functions, which could still benefit from optimizing Einsum as a framework.
